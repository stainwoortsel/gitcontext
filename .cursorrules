# GitContext Integration Rules

# Always maintain context in .gitcontext/
- When starting a new feature, create a context branch:
  `git-context branch feature/<name>`

- Before making changes, check current context:
  `git-context status`

- After completing a task, commit with OTA logs:
  `git-context commit "description" --ota-file .gitcontext/temp/last_ota.json`

- When exploring alternatives, document rejected approaches in commit alternatives

- Before merging, analyze branch and suggest squash strategy

# OTA Logging Format
When working, log your thought process:
{
  "thought": "what I'm considering",
  "action": "what I'm doing",
  "result": "what happened",
  "files_affected": ["file1.py", "file2.js"]
}


# Use GitContext for memory
- Before coding: git-context status
- After changes: git-context commit "summary"
- For experiments: git-context branch feature/name
